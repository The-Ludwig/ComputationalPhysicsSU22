Computational Physics SU 2022 
===

My solutions for the computational physics course at Stockholm University summer 2022.
Written in (hopefully somewhat modern) C++ using CMake and Conan.io. Visualization using python.


## Running it

Each directory is a project, optimally there will be a `Makefile`, which you just need to run, to get
a hand-in-ready zipfile. 
You need:
* GCC
* Make 
* CMake>=3.12
* conan.io
* Python3 (matplotlib)

## Ideas for the future

* CD
* tests 
* poetry for python

## Resources 
For documentation purposes, here are the resources I used to learn something about `CMake` and `conan`
* [Henry Schreiner's Modern CMake](https://cliutils.gitlab.io/modern-cmake/)
* [CMake Documentation](https://cmake.org/documentation/)
* [conan Documentation](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/)
