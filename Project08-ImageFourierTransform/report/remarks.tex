\section{Final Remarks}
Some images will appear to have a slightly different color-mix when transformed back
to real space. This is not so much of a feature of the Fourier transform, rather, it
has to do with the normalization we apply to the pixels after the inverse transform.
If one takes a little more attention to color-normalization, one can retain
the color profile.
